## Prompt

/sp.constitution read all the files in hackathon_docs and create the strong constitution also add this note in detailed in constitution(note: always use the skills and sub-agents when you are working in related field, and get the latest documentation from context7 when needed or want to learn new skill.)

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution v1.0.0 for Hackathon II - Todo Evolution project with 9 core principles:

1. **Spec-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)** - Strict workflow: Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement
2. **Skills & Subagents First** - Must leverage `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` before implementation
3. **Context7 Knowledge Acquisition** - Query Context7 MCP for up-to-date documentation
4. **No Manual Coding** - All code generated by Claude Code via approved specifications
5. **Phase Governance** - 5 sequential phases with strict scoping
6. **Technology Constraints** - Mandatory stack (FastAPI, Next.js, SQLModel, etc.)
7. **Agent Behavior Rules** - 7 rules including task ID requirements and hierarchy
8. **Quality & Architecture Principles** - Clean architecture, error handling, stateless design
9. **Cloud-Native Readiness** - Containerization, Kubernetes, observability patterns

Constitution includes Technology Stack, Development Workflow, and Governance sections.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Major - Initial constitution created governing entire hackathon project
- 🧪 Tests: N/A - Constitution is a governance document
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify for Phase I, /sp.plan for implementation planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully integrates user's note about skills, subagents, and Context7 as Principles II and III

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution created successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All template placeholders replaced, all principles testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if agents follow Constitution Check in plan.md
